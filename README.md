The project consists of a grid where users can draw by hovering over individual squares.
It supports dynamic resizing of the grid, as well as a "rainbow mode" for random colors.

## Features

- **Change grid size**: Use the input field to change the grid's dimensions (from 4x4 to 100x100 squares).
- **Rainbow Mode**: Toggle a rainbow color mode that changes the drawing color randomly.
- **Clear Grid**: Reset the grid to its original empty state.

## How to Use
